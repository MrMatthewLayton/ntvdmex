# Project State — Living Handoff

> **This is the canonical resume point.** Update it at the end of every working session.

- **Last updated:** 2026-06-04
- **Phase:** M2 — DOS kernel (M0 + M1 done)
- **Overall status:** 🟢 **The keystone is proven.** A real DOS `.COM`, loaded off disk, runs on the
  real CPU in **Virtual-8086 mode** via `NtVdmControl` and prints "Hello, World" through our own INT
  21h handler — launched transparently when XP starts a 16-bit program (IFEO redirect). The whole
  pipeline runs end-to-end from a from-scratch host, with **no Microsoft VDM binaries**.

## One-paragraph summary

We are building a drop-in replacement for Windows XP SP3 (32-bit) `ntvdm.exe` that runs 16-bit DOS
and Win16 code on the **real CPU in V86 mode** by driving XP's existing kernel VDM machinery through
the undocumented `NtVdmControl` syscall. Interception is the **IFEO `Debugger` redirect** on
`ntvdm.exe` (registry-only, no signed system file replaced). Devices (video, sound, input, net) are
virtualized and serviced by host calls through a pluggable VDD model; video is blitted into a
Luna-themed window. Work is tracked per step through **Research → Spike → Impl → Test → Done** (see
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)).

## Proven pipeline (M0 → M2.3)

From `tools/vdmhost/vdmhost.c` (the spike), in one process — real `.COM` and `.EXE` programs run,
with file I/O:

1. **Intercept** — IFEO `Debugger` on `ntvdm.exe` → our binary runs in ntvdm's place (ADR-0007).
2. **CSRSS handshake** — `RegisterConsoleVDM` + `GetNextVDMCommand` → resolves the program to run
   (`CurDir\Title`). (The `0x57` that blocked this for ages was a console-key harness artifact, not
   a real binding problem — the lookup is keyed on the console handle.)
3. **Kernel V86 monitor** — V86 memory map + `NtVdmControl(VdmInitialize)` + a **self-allocated
   VDM_TIB** registered at `TEB+0xF18` (the kernel does *not* allocate it — ntvdm does).
4. **Execute** — `NtVdmControl(VdmStartExecution)` runs the guest on the CPU; CONTEXT lives at
   `VDM_TIB+0x2D8`.
5. **DOS services** — `INT 21h` reflects through the real-mode **IVT** to a **BOP** (`C4 C4 nn`)
   handler that returns to the host (event 4); host services it, advances EIP past the BOP, and
   re-enters so the handler's `IRET` resumes the guest. Multiple syscalls per run.
6. **DOS process model (M2.1–M2.3)** — the V86 memory map now covers the **full 640KB** (ntvdm builds
   FOUR section maps; we were missing Map 3 `section[0x10000..]→0x10000 size 0x90000`, which is why
   guests faulted at `0x10000`). A real **PSP** is built at `PSP_SEG:0` (`0x1000`); `.COM` loads at
   `PSP:0x100`, `.EXE` (MZ) is parsed → load module at `PSP_SEG+0x10`, relocations applied,
   `CS:IP`/`SS:SP` from the header. **INT 21h surface:** `02/09` console, `40` write, `3C/3D/3E/3F/42`
   file I/O → Win32 handles (table `g_fh[]`, slots 5+), `30` version. **CF is returned on the pushed
   FLAGS at `SS:SP+4`** (the handler's `IRET` restores FLAGS, so the live `EFlags` would be clobbered);
   `AX` etc. persist via the context.

## What is decided (see [decisions/](decisions/))

- **ADR-0001** — No CPU emulation; execute real-mode code in V86. *Accepted.*
- **ADR-0002** — Intercept via WOW registry repoint. **Superseded by ADR-0007** (repoint disproven).
- **ADR-0003** — Scope = DOS **+** Win16/WOW; Win16 deferred to M5 behind a clean seam. *Accepted.*
- **ADR-0004** — Reuse kernel VDM via `NtVdmControl` rather than a custom V86 driver.
  **Accepted** (the V86 keystone is proven; no custom driver needed).
- **ADR-0005** — Target XP in a VM **and** bare metal; VM-first for the dev loop. *Accepted.*
- **ADR-0006** — Build with mingw-w64 (i686) cross-compiler, no C runtime. *Accepted.*
- **ADR-0007** — Intercept via the IFEO `Debugger` redirect on `ntvdm.exe`. *Accepted.*

## What is built

- **`tools/vdmhost/` — the spike that proves M0+M1+M2.1–M2.3.** The full pipeline above: IFEO host →
  CSRSS handshake → V86 → DOS process (PSP, 640KB, `.COM`/`.EXE` loader) → INT 21h/BOP service loop
  (console + Win32-backed file I/O). Tested on the VM: `hello.com`/`testps.com` (`.COM` + PSP command
  tail), `filewr.com` (creates/writes/reads a real disk file), `helloexe.exe` (MZ with a relocation).
  This is throwaway-grade experiment code, *not* the clean host.
- **Shell preview (`src/`):** a fixed 80×25 DOS-style Luna-themed console (GDI text grid), the future
  sink for INT 10h / B800 text writes. Confirmed running on XP SP3. **Still non-interactive** — the
  DOS core has not yet been promoted into it (that's M2.6).
- **Build system:** CMake + mingw-w64 i686 cross, no-CRT (`cmake/toolchain-xp32-mingw.cmake`).
- **Dev bench:** QEMU XP SP3 VM (HVF = real V86) via `scripts/xp-vm.sh`; QMP socket for
  `screendump`/`send-key`; telnet (`scripts/xp.py`) drives the guest; TFTP pushes binaries
  (host→guest). Reverse-engineering inputs (extracted MS binaries) in gitignored `reverse/`.

## What is open / next

**Phase M2 (DOS kernel).** Trackable sub-steps with exit criteria are in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md):
M2.1 process setup (PSP + ≥640KB map), M2.2 INT 21h surface (file I/O via Win32 + console),
M2.3 MZ `.EXE` loader, M2.4 DOS memory management, M2.5 process plumbing, M2.6 promote spike → `src/`.

The big structural reality the stage model exposes: **almost everything is at ✅ Spike / ⬜ Impl.**
We've *proven* the DOS core in `vdmhost`; the clean `src/` implementation is essentially unwritten.

## Single next action

**M2.1–M2.3 done** (all proven as spikes on the VM): full 640KB map + PSP + `.COM` at `PSP:0x100`
(M2.1); INT 21h file I/O backed by Win32 — a program created/wrote/read a real file (M2.2); MZ `.EXE`
loader with relocations + `CS:IP`/`SS:SP` from the header (M2.3). Both `.COM` and `.EXE` run.

Next, pick one:
- **M2.4 — DOS memory management** (MCB chain + AH=48/49/4A alloc/free/resize): many real programs
  allocate memory. Documented; Impl-heavy.
- **M2.5 thread — command-line recovery**: `GetNextVDMCommand` never populated `CmdLine`, so the PSP
  command tail is a fixed placeholder. Recovering real args is its own Research dive (how ntvdm gets
  the command line — likely a second VDM call / the env-block protocol we partly mapped).
- **Validate on a real-world DOS `.EXE`** (not hand-built) to drive priorities empirically — would
  surface which INT 21h functions / memory calls real software actually needs.

## Environment notes

- Git repo on `main`; remote is the private GitHub repo (no Wiki — `docs/` is canonical).
- Build host: macOS with Homebrew `mingw-w64` (i686, UCRT-default → we link no-CRT) + CMake + r2.
- **Never commit:** the XP ISO, `vm/`, `*.qcow2`, or `reverse/` (extracted MS binaries) — gitignored.
- The Bash tool is sometimes sandboxed (process/socket checks can read false-negative); use
  `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` for QEMU/QMP/`lsof` operations.
