/*
 * wowuser.h -- USER.EXE's half of the WOW32 interface. GH #128, session 38.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE AND NOT MORE CASES IN wow32.h ────────────────
 * THE ID SPACE IS PER MODULE. Every id in wow32.h was read out of krnl386's own
 * stub table; USER has its own table of 457 stubs with its own numbering, and the
 * numbers COLLIDE. `0x39` is `GetProfileInt` in krnl386's table and
 * `RegisterClass` in USER's -- and for one run this host serviced the second with
 * the first and handed WOWEXEC the answer. Two id spaces in one switch is how that
 * happens; two files with two dispatchers, chosen by the stub's own segment, is how
 * it stops happening.
 *
 * The surface is enumerated in docs/research/wow-user-surface.md -- 441 ids, 262 of
 * them named by USER's own export table, regenerable with
 *     tools/ne/wowmap.py guest/ne/user.exe --md
 *
 * ── THE Win16 WNDCLASS, CONFIRMED FIELD BY FIELD AGAINST WOWEXEC's OWN CODE ──
 * Not taken from a header. WOWEXEC builds one on its stack and every store lands
 * where this layout says it should:
 *
 *     083b  lea ax,[bp-0x1a]        -> the struct is 0x1A = 26 bytes
 *     0819  lcall LoadCursor
 *     081e  mov [bp-0xc],ax          -> +0x0e  hCursor
 *     0823  lcall <stock object>
 *     0828  mov [bp-0xa],ax          -> +0x10  hbrBackground
 *     082b  mov word [bp-4],0x82     -> +0x16  lpszClassName offset
 *     0830  mov [bp-2],ds            -> +0x18  lpszClassName segment
 *     0833  sub ax,ax / mov [bp-6],ax / mov [bp-8],ax  -> +0x12/+0x14 lpszMenuName = NULL
 *
 *   +0x00 WORD  style          +0x0c WORD hIcon
 *   +0x02 DWORD lpfnWndProc    +0x0e WORD hCursor
 *   +0x06 WORD  cbClsExtra     +0x10 WORD hbrBackground
 *   +0x08 WORD  cbWndExtra     +0x12 DWORD lpszMenuName
 *   +0x0a WORD  hInstance      +0x16 DWORD lpszClassName
 *
 * ⚠ `mov word [bp-4],0x82` is the CLASS NAME POINTER, not a style. An earlier note
 *   read it as "style 0x82, hInstance=ds" off the same two instructions; the offsets
 *   above are what settle it, and they come from the struct size the program itself
 *   declares with that `lea`.

         Named by USER's own export table: ordinal 57 `REGISTERCLASS` is a wrapper
         at seg1:0x1dbd that TAIL-JUMPS to the stub at seg1:0x0c18, and that stub
         pushes id 0x39 with 4 argument bytes -- one far pointer. The caller tests
         `or ax,ax`, so 0 is failure and any non-zero value is the class ATOM.
       ★ REGISTERING IS REAL WORK, NOT A STUB. The window procedure, the class
         styles and the extra-bytes counts are what CreateWindow and DefWindowProc
         will need, and they are only available here -- the guest hands them over
         once and then refers to the class by name. So keep them.
       ⚠ THE ATOM MUST BE STABLE AND NON-ZERO. Win16 atoms live at 0xC000 and up;
         a second RegisterClass of the same name returns the SAME atom rather than
         allocating another, because a program that re-registers (WOWEXEC does, once
         per relaunch) must not exhaust the table. */
